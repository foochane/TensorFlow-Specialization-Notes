Working through “Hello World” in TensorFlow and Python

### Before you begin:TensorFlow 2.0 and this course

We've gotten a lot of questions about whether this course teaches TensorFlow 2.0 or 1.x.

The answer is: Both!

We've designed the curriculum for the early modules in this course to have code that's generic enough that it works with both versions, so you are welcome to try it with the 2.0 alpha. If you are using the colabs, you'll use the latest version of TensorFlow that Google Colaboratory supports, which, at time of writing is 1.13. You can replace this with 2.0 by adding a codeblock containing:
```s

!pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0 
```


Working through ‘Hello World’ in TensorFlow and Python






Excercise 1 
In this exercise you'll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.

So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.

How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.

Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# GRADED FUNCTION: house_model
def house_model(y_new):
    xs = np.array([1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0],dtype=float)
    ys = np.array([100000,150000,200000,250000,300000,350000])
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])
    model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')
    model.fit(xs,ys,epochs=500)
    return model.predict(y_new)[0]

prediction = house_model([7.0])
print(prediction)
```


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    if(logs.get('acc')>0.6):
      print("\nReached 60% accuracy so cancelling training!")
      self.model.stop_training = True

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

callbacks = myCallback()

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[callbacks])
```
